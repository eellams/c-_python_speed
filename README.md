Speedtest
===

Comparing the relative speed of execution of boost::python object methods vs C++ extracted methods.

They seem pretty much the same speed-wise (chose the one that best suits your programming needs).

Produces a CSV file of some of the test results. By no means a thorough test, but it'll do for now!
